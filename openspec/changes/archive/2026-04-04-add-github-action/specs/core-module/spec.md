## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Scanner functions
The core module SHALL export scanner functions that accept a base path and return structured OpenSpec data. The `build-demo.ts` script SHALL separate the concept of "data source path" (where openspec/ lives) from "build tooling path" (where spek's packages/web lives), allowing the script to scan an external repository while using spek's own build tooling.

#### Scenario: Scan overview
- **WHEN** `scanOverview(basePath)` is called with a valid repo path
- **THEN** it returns `{ specsCount, changesCount: { active, archived }, taskStats: { total, completed } }`

#### Scenario: List specs
- **WHEN** `listSpecs(basePath)` is called
- **THEN** it returns an array of `{ topic, path }` for each spec directory

#### Scenario: Read single spec
- **WHEN** `readSpec(basePath, topic)` is called with an existing topic
- **THEN** it returns `{ topic, content, relatedChanges, history }`

#### Scenario: Build demo from external repo
- **WHEN** `build-demo.ts` is called with `--repo-dir` pointing to a different repository
- **THEN** all `@spek/core` functions receive the external repo path as `basePath`
- **AND** Vite build still runs from spek's own `packages/web` directory
