## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Spec history data in API response
The system SHALL include a `history` array in the `GET /api/openspec/specs/:topic` response. Each entry MUST contain the change slug, date (if parseable from slug), description, and status (active or archived).

#### Scenario: Spec with related changes
- **WHEN** a spec has been affected by one or more changes (i.e., changes that contain a delta spec for this topic)
- **THEN** the API response includes a `history` array with entries sorted by date descending (most recent first)
- **AND** each entry contains `{ slug, date, description, status }`

#### Scenario: Spec with no related changes
- **WHEN** a spec has no related changes
- **THEN** the API response includes an empty `history` array

### Requirement: Spec history timeline UI
The system SHALL display a visual timeline on the SpecDetail page showing all changes that affected the spec. Each timeline entry MUST display the date, change description, and a link to the change detail page.

#### Scenario: Display history timeline
- **WHEN** the SpecDetail page is rendered for a spec with related changes
- **THEN** a "History" section is displayed with a vertical timeline showing each change chronologically

#### Scenario: Timeline entry links to change
- **WHEN** the user clicks on a timeline entry
- **THEN** the system navigates to the corresponding change detail page

#### Scenario: No history
- **WHEN** the SpecDetail page is rendered for a spec with no related changes
- **THEN** the "History" section displays a message indicating no changes have affected this spec
