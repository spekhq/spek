## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sidebar navigation
The system SHALL render a sidebar with navigation links: Overview (Dashboard), Specs, Changes, and Graph. Each link SHALL have an associated icon (LayoutDashboard for Overview, FileText for Specs, GitBranch for Changes, Share2 for Graph). The current route SHALL be visually highlighted. On viewports below 768px, the sidebar SHALL be hidden by default and displayed as an overlay when toggled. On viewports at or above 768px, the sidebar SHALL support two states: expanded (240px width, showing icons and labels) and collapsed (56px width, showing icons only). A toggle button at the bottom of the sidebar SHALL switch between states. The main content area left margin SHALL adjust to match the current sidebar width.
