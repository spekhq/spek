## Requirements

### Requirement: File change detection for Web version

The Web server SHALL monitor OpenSpec content for file changes using `chokidar` and push notifications to connected clients via Server-Sent Events (SSE). When worktree aggregation is active for a connection, the server SHALL monitor the `openspec/` directory of every aggregated worktree, so that changes made in any worktree (for example by a parallel agent) refresh the aggregated view.

#### Scenario: SSE endpoint connection

- **WHEN** a client connects to `GET /api/openspec/watch?dir=<repoPath>`
- **THEN** the server opens an SSE stream and begins monitoring `<repoPath>/openspec/` for `.md` and `.yaml` file changes

#### Scenario: File change notification

- **WHEN** a `.md` or `.yaml` file inside a monitored `openspec/` directory is created, modified, or deleted
- **THEN** the server sends an SSE event `data: {"type":"changed"}` to all connected clients for that directory, debounced at 500ms

#### Scenario: Watch all worktrees under aggregation

- **WHEN** a client connects with aggregation active and the repository has multiple worktrees
- **THEN** the server monitors the `openspec/` directory of every worktree
- **AND** a `.md` or `.yaml` change in any of those worktrees triggers a `data: {"type":"changed"}` event

#### Scenario: Client disconnect cleanup

- **WHEN** a client disconnects from the SSE endpoint
- **THEN** the server removes the client from the notification list and cleans up the watcher(s) if no other clients are connected for that directory

#### Scenario: Shared watcher per directory

- **WHEN** multiple clients connect to the same `dir` parameter
- **THEN** the server SHALL reuse the same chokidar watcher instance(s) for that directory

### Requirement: File change detection for VS Code version

The VS Code extension SHALL monitor OpenSpec content for file changes and notify the webview. Monitoring SHALL reliably detect files that are created or modified inside directories which were themselves newly created (for example a change's `specs/<topic>/` delta-spec directory), even when the directory and its contents are created in the same rapid write burst. When worktree aggregation is active, the extension SHALL also monitor the `openspec/` directory of every other worktree of the same repository, not only the workspace folder.

#### Scenario: Watcher setup

- **WHEN** the spek Webview Panel is created
- **THEN** the extension host starts a recursive `chokidar` watcher on the workspace folder's `openspec/` directory

#### Scenario: Detect files in newly created nested directories

- **WHEN** a delta-spec file is created at `openspec/changes/<slug>/specs/<topic>/spec.md` and its parent directories `specs/` and `specs/<topic>/` did not previously exist
- **THEN** the watcher detects the new `spec.md` and triggers a webview notification
- **AND** subsequent modifications to that `spec.md` are also detected and trigger a notification

#### Scenario: Watch other worktrees under aggregation

- **WHEN** worktree aggregation is active and the repository has worktrees outside the current workspace folder
- **THEN** the extension host starts a `chokidar` watcher on the `openspec/` directory of each such worktree

#### Scenario: File change notification to webview

- **WHEN** a `.md` or `.yaml` file, or a directory, inside a monitored `openspec/` directory is created, modified, or deleted
- **THEN** the extension host sends `{ type: "fileChanged" }` to the webview via `postMessage`, debounced at 500ms

#### Scenario: Watcher cleanup

- **WHEN** the spek Webview Panel is disposed
- **THEN** all file watchers SHALL be closed along with other panel resources

### Requirement: RefreshContext for frontend refresh coordination
The frontend SHALL provide a `RefreshContext` that coordinates data refresh across all hooks when file changes are detected.

#### Scenario: RefreshContext provides refreshKey
- **WHEN** a component or hook calls `useRefreshKey()`
- **THEN** it receives the current `refreshKey` number value from the context

#### Scenario: Refresh triggered by file change
- **WHEN** `refresh()` from `RefreshContext` is called
- **THEN** the `refreshKey` counter increments, causing all `useAsyncData` hooks to re-fetch their data

### Requirement: useFileWatcher hook
The frontend SHALL provide a `useFileWatcher` hook that connects to the appropriate file change event source based on the runtime environment.

#### Scenario: Web environment with SSE
- **WHEN** `useFileWatcher` is active in the Web environment
- **THEN** it opens an `EventSource` connection to `/api/openspec/watch?dir=<repoPath>` and calls `refresh()` on each received event

#### Scenario: VS Code environment with postMessage
- **WHEN** `useFileWatcher` is active in the VS Code webview environment
- **THEN** it listens for `message` events with `type === "fileChanged"` and calls `refresh()` on each received event

#### Scenario: Demo environment no-op
- **WHEN** `useFileWatcher` is active in the Demo environment
- **THEN** it does nothing (no event source to connect to)

#### Scenario: Cleanup on unmount
- **WHEN** the component using `useFileWatcher` unmounts
- **THEN** the EventSource connection or message listener SHALL be cleaned up

### Requirement: Debounced re-fetch in useAsyncData
The `useAsyncData` hook SHALL support automatic re-fetch triggered by `refreshKey` changes with debounce to avoid excessive requests.

#### Scenario: Re-fetch on refreshKey change
- **WHEN** `refreshKey` changes in the `RefreshContext`
- **THEN** `useAsyncData` triggers a new fetch after a 300ms debounce delay

#### Scenario: Debounce coalesces rapid changes
- **WHEN** `refreshKey` changes multiple times within 300ms
- **THEN** only one re-fetch is triggered after the last change

#### Scenario: Existing data preserved during re-fetch
- **WHEN** a re-fetch is triggered by `refreshKey` change
- **THEN** the existing `data` SHALL remain visible (no loading flash) until the new data arrives

#### Scenario: Refresh failure with existing data
- **WHEN** a re-fetch triggered by `refreshKey` change fails with an error
- **AND** the hook already has existing data from a previous successful fetch
- **THEN** the existing `data` SHALL be preserved
- **AND** the `error` state SHALL NOT be set (remains null)

#### Scenario: Refresh failure without existing data
- **WHEN** a re-fetch triggered by `refreshKey` change fails with an error
- **AND** the hook has no existing data (data is null)
- **THEN** the `error` state SHALL be set to the error message
