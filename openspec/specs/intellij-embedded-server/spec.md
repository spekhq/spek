## Purpose

以 IntelliJ 內建 HTTP server 提供 REST API，供 JCEF 內嵌前端讀取 OpenSpec 資料。

## Requirements

### Requirement: HTTP request handler registration
The plugin SHALL register an `HttpRequestHandler` with the IntelliJ built-in server to handle REST API requests under the path prefix `/api/spek/`. All API endpoints SHALL accept a `projectPath` query parameter to identify the target project.

#### Scenario: API endpoint routing
- **WHEN** the built-in server receives a request to `/api/spek/openspec/overview?projectPath=/path/to/project`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL route it to the overview handler and return JSON response

#### Scenario: Unknown endpoint
- **WHEN** the built-in server receives a request to `/api/spek/unknown`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL return HTTP 404

### Requirement: Overview endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/overview` that returns specs count, changes count, and task statistics.

#### Scenario: Overview response
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/overview?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns `{ specsCount, changesCount, taskStats: { total, completed } }`

### Requirement: Specs list endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs` that returns a list of all specs with their topic names and descriptions.

#### Scenario: Specs list response
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns an array of `{ topic, title, description, updatedAt }` objects

### Requirement: Spec detail endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs/:topic` that returns the full content of a single spec including its markdown content and history.

#### Scenario: Spec detail found
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs/dashboard-view?projectPath=...` is called
- **AND** `openspec/specs/dashboard-view/spec.md` exists
- **THEN** it returns the spec content with history entries

#### Scenario: Spec not found
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs/nonexistent?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Spec at change endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs/:topic/at/:slug` that returns the spec content as it exists within a specific change's delta specs.

#### Scenario: Spec version found
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/specs/api-adapter/at/2026-02-13-phase1?projectPath=...` is called
- **AND** the change contains a delta spec for `api-adapter`
- **THEN** it returns `{ content: "..." }` with the delta spec content

### Requirement: Changes list endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/changes` that returns active and archived changes. Each returned change SHALL include a `createdDate` field (string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format or null) parsed from the change's `.openspec.yaml` `created` frontmatter field, and an `archivedDate` field (string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format or null) derived from the archive folder name prefix `YYYY-MM-DD-slug` for archived changes and null for active changes, matching the `@spek/core` (TypeScript) contract.

#### Scenario: Changes list response
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/changes?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns `{ active: [...], archived: [...] }` with change metadata

#### Scenario: Active change includes createdDate from .openspec.yaml
- **WHEN** an active change directory contains `.openspec.yaml` with `created: 2026-07-05`
- **THEN** its entry in `active` SHALL include `createdDate` equal to `"2026-07-05"` and `archivedDate` equal to null

#### Scenario: Archived change includes createdDate and archivedDate
- **WHEN** an archived change directory named `2026-07-05-foo` contains `.openspec.yaml` with `created: 2026-07-01`
- **THEN** its entry in `archived` SHALL include `createdDate` equal to `"2026-07-01"` and `archivedDate` equal to `"2026-07-05"`

#### Scenario: Missing or malformed created yields null createdDate
- **WHEN** a change has no `.openspec.yaml`, or its `created` value does not match `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **THEN** its `createdDate` SHALL be null

### Requirement: Change detail endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/changes/:slug` that returns full change details including proposal, design, tasks content, and affected specs. The response SHALL also include `createdDate` and `archivedDate` fields, populated from the same sources as the corresponding changes-list entry (`.openspec.yaml` `created` frontmatter and archive folder name prefix respectively).

#### Scenario: Change detail found
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/changes/2026-02-13-phase1?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns the change with proposal, design, tasks markdown content and affected specs list
- **AND** the response includes `createdDate` and `archivedDate` fields

### Requirement: Graph data endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/graph` that returns spec-change relationship data for visualization.

#### Scenario: Graph data response
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/graph?projectPath=...` is called
- **THEN** it returns nodes and edges representing specs and their related changes

### Requirement: Search endpoint
The server SHALL implement `GET /api/spek/openspec/search` with a `q` query parameter that performs full-text search across all spec and change content.

#### Scenario: Search with results
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/search?projectPath=...&q=dashboard` is called
- **THEN** it returns matching results with type, title, and context snippets

#### Scenario: Search with no results
- **WHEN** `GET /api/spek/openspec/search?projectPath=...&q=xyznonexistent` is called
- **THEN** it returns an empty array

### Requirement: OpenSpec scanner (Kotlin)
The server SHALL implement a Kotlin-based OpenSpec scanner that reads the `openspec/` directory structure. The scanner SHALL read `.md` and `.yaml` files only, and SHALL not expose arbitrary filesystem access.

#### Scenario: Scan directory structure
- **WHEN** the scanner processes a project with `openspec/specs/` and `openspec/changes/`
- **THEN** it returns a structured representation of all specs and changes with their metadata

#### Scenario: Security constraint
- **WHEN** a request attempts to read files outside the `openspec/` directory
- **THEN** the server SHALL reject the request

### Requirement: CORS headers for JCEF
The server SHALL include appropriate CORS headers to allow requests from the JCEF webview (which loads content from file:// or the built-in server).

#### Scenario: CORS preflight
- **WHEN** the JCEF webview sends a cross-origin request to the API
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers permitting the request

### Requirement: API handler readiness check before webview load
The plugin SHALL verify that `SpekHttpRequestHandler` is responding to HTTP requests before loading the webview URL in JCEF. This ensures the frontend does not encounter HTTP 404 errors due to the handler not being registered yet.

#### Scenario: Handler becomes ready before timeout
- **WHEN** the built-in server has started
- **AND** `SpekBrowserPanel` polls the API health check endpoint
- **AND** the handler responds with HTTP 200 within the timeout period
- **THEN** the panel SHALL proceed to load the webview URL

#### Scenario: Handler not ready yet
- **WHEN** the built-in server has started
- **AND** the API health check endpoint returns non-200 or connection fails
- **THEN** the panel SHALL wait 200ms and retry the health check
- **AND** the panel SHALL check the `disposed` state before each retry

#### Scenario: Timeout exceeded
- **WHEN** the health check has been retried for more than 10 seconds without success
- **THEN** the panel SHALL proceed to load the webview URL as a fallback
- **AND** the panel SHALL log a warning about the timeout
