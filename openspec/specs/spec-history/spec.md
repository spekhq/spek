## Purpose

Surface how a single spec evolved across the changes that touched it, active and archived alike.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Spec history data in API response
The system SHALL include a `history` array in the `GET /api/openspec/specs/:topic` response. Each entry MUST contain the change slug, date (if parseable from slug), timestamp (ISO 8601 from git commit cache, or null if unavailable), description, and status (active or archived).

#### Scenario: Spec with related changes
- **WHEN** a spec has been affected by one or more changes (i.e., changes that contain a delta spec for this topic)
- **THEN** the API response includes a `history` array with entries sorted by git commit timestamp descending (most recent first)
- **AND** if two entries have the same date, the git commit timestamp determines their order
- **AND** each entry contains `{ slug, date, timestamp, description, status }`

#### Scenario: Spec with no related changes
- **WHEN** a spec has no related changes
- **THEN** the API response includes an empty `history` array

#### Scenario: Fallback sorting when git timestamp unavailable
- **WHEN** a history entry has no git commit timestamp (e.g., uncommitted change or non-git repo)
- **THEN** the entry's `timestamp` field is null
- **AND** sorting falls back to the date parsed from the slug

### Requirement: Spec history timeline UI
The system SHALL display a visual timeline on the SpecDetail page showing all changes that affected the spec. Each timeline entry MUST display the date, change description, and a link to the change detail page. Each timeline entry SHALL also include a "Compare" action that triggers diff comparison against the current spec content.

#### Scenario: Display history timeline
- **WHEN** the SpecDetail page is rendered for a spec with related changes
- **THEN** a "History" section is displayed with a vertical timeline showing each change chronologically

#### Scenario: Timeline entry links to change
- **WHEN** the user clicks on a timeline entry's title or description
- **THEN** the system navigates to the corresponding change detail page

#### Scenario: No history
- **WHEN** the SpecDetail page is rendered for a spec with no related changes
- **THEN** the "History" section displays a message indicating no changes have affected this spec

#### Scenario: Timeline entry compare action
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Compare" action on a timeline entry
- **THEN** the system enters diff comparison mode showing the difference between that change version and the current spec content
