 * background (`bg-<token>/<alpha>`), a token tint used as a border (`border-<token>/<alpha>`),
 * `opacity-*` on anything, a `--color-*` token reaching SVG, and **a palette handed to a renderer that
 * generates its own markup** (`DIAGRAM_COLORS`, measured below).
 *
 * That last one is the same lesson as the SVG entry, reached from the other end. Mermaid writes our
 * colours into an SVG that does not exist until a reader opens the page, so neither the CSS parse nor
 * any source scan here can see a single one of them — the check would find nothing to report, which is
 * indistinguishable from finding nothing wrong. The answer is to measure at the **declaration**: the
 * table in `utils/diagramTheme.ts` is the complete set of colours handed over, and it is measured here
 * entry by entry. A key the application deliberately leaves to Mermaid is listed in that module's
 * `DECLARED_DEFAULTS` with its reason, and `diagramTheme.test.ts` fails on one that is in neither — the
 * two halves are split that way because this file measures ratios and that one holds the table's own
 * invariants.
 *
 * That last one used to sit in the list below, on the strength of a single decorative occurrence. It
 * moved when the schema workflow diagram began stating its dependencies, its declared-vs-derived
 * distinction and its not-declared-by-this-schema mark entirely through SVG — an exclusion is a claim
 * about how the app uses a mechanism, and the app goes on being written. It is scanned by the **token**,
 * not by the attribute: the arrowhead colours live in an object literal and reach the element as
 * `fill={color}`, so an attribute-scoped pattern would have missed them while reporting the diagram as
 * covered, and matching the token needs no multi-line parse that could bridge two elements.
 *
 * The SVG scan is by token, so it forces a decision on a token nobody has classified — not on a second
 * use of one already classified. That residue is stated with the scan itself.
 *
 * **Not enumerated**, and each would need its own scan: inline `style={{ color }}`; a bare `opacity` /
 * `fill-opacity` / `stroke-opacity` SVG attribute on an element whose colour is *not* a token —
 * `currentColor` and literal fills, which is the checkmark disc's `opacity="0.2"` in `ChangeDetail` and
 * the two marks in `Layout`, all measured by hand and passing; `ring-*` / `outline-*` / gradient
 * utilities; and literal alphas of non-token colours (`bg-black/60` scrims). A mechanism the app begins
 * to use belongs here or in a scan, not in neither — and one already here belongs in a scan as soon as
 * the app starts saying something with it.
