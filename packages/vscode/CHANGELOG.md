# Changelog

## 1.18.1

- **VS Code in a browser no longer opens a broken tab on every in-app click** ([#59](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/59)). In code-server, GitHub Codespaces and vscode.dev, clicking the sidebar's Overview / Specs / Changes, a change card or a spec link also opened a new browser tab at a 404 address, on top of the navigation that did happen inside the panel. VS Code forwards every link click in a webview to the workbench to open, even one the page already handled; desktop VS Code silently refuses those addresses, which is why the bug never showed there. In-app links now stay in the panel, external links still open as before, and the spec page's table of contents scrolls smoothly instead of jumping. Thanks to [@Philogag](https://github.com/Philogag) for reporting

The release's other two fixes are to the GitHub Action and its generated HTML snapshot, which the extension does not use.

## 1.18.0

**Highlight: a keyword's casing is read the way OpenSpec reads it.** spek marked one casing rule across every keyword it highlights, and the keywords do not carry the same obligation. A scenario body is free text that no version of OpenSpec parses, so uppercase `WHEN` / `THEN` is a template convention — a spec written with `**Given**` / `**When**` / `**Then**` is perfectly valid and rendered with no highlighting at all. `SHALL` / `MUST` is the opposite: OpenSpec matches it case-sensitively. The rule is now decided per keyword group.

- **Title-case Gherkin steps are highlighted** ([#53](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/53)). `Given`, `When`, `Then` and `And` are marked when the whole emphasised run is the keyword — `**Given** a project is registered`. Uppercase is unchanged
- **Ordinary prose is not marked.** A requirement beginning "When the server receives a request, it SHALL respond" marks only `SHALL`, as before
- **`MUST` / `SHALL` and the four delta operations stay uppercase-only.** Red means *normative* here and lowercase "must" is an ordinary verb; `**Modified**:` heads an impact list in many proposals and names no delta operation there
- **No keyword is highlighted inside a heading.** An emphasised one used to be — `## **ADDED** Requirements` showed a badge while the unemphasised form every spec actually uses did not
- **A requirement or scenario heading drops its keyword whatever the casing**, in the panel and in the Specs sidebar alike. `### requirement: Foo` displays as `Foo`, as `### Requirement: Foo` already did

## 1.17.0

**Highlight: search finds what is actually there.** spek implemented search four times — the web server, the VS Code host, the IntelliJ server and the static build — and the four answered the same query differently. The host carried a verbatim copy of the web server's index, which scored an exact match out of the results once it sat more than about 40 characters into a file, so search was effectively blind past the first line of anything. The rule is now stated once, and every surface runs it.

- **A term that appears verbatim is found, wherever it sits in the file** ([#51](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/51)). The fuzzy index ranked a match by its distance from the start of the document and discarded anything further in. Typo tolerance is gone with it: matching is now exact and case-insensitive
- **A change is found by its own name** — in the form the result card shows it, so a query copied off a result finds that result. The host previously matched file content only
- **One result per spec and per change**, taken from the file that actually contains the query. A term in three of a change's files used to list it three times, and a name match used to hand back a snippet with nothing the reader typed in it
- **Each result says which artifact answered and marks archived changes**, so a row explains itself even when there is nothing to highlight in it
- **Results are ordered the same way as on every other surface**, with the most recently archived change first rather than the oldest

## 1.16.0

**Highlight: a change's non-Markdown artifacts are visible.** A schema sets each artifact's filename through `generates:`, and not every artifact is Markdown — `event-driven` requires `asyncapi.yaml`. spek discovered only root `*.md` and the `specs/` tree, so such a change rendered every tab except the one its schema asks for.

- **Root `.yaml` / `.yml` / `.json` files are artifacts**, shown as syntax-highlighted text. The tab is named for the file's stem with a format badge, using the full filename only when a Markdown artifact shares it. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#50](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/50))
- **They sort into their schema position**, count in the change-list badge, are reachable by search, and refresh live on edit
- **Discovery stays root-only and skips dotfiles**, so `.openspec.yaml` and subdirectory files never become tabs
- **Code fences in `proposal.md` / `design.md` are highlighted too.** A fence with no language stays plain

## 1.15.0

**Highlight: the schema workflow diagram now says which steps come *after* implementation — and its lines can finally be seen.** OpenSpec has no way to declare "this artifact is produced once the change is implemented": an artifact's `requires` may name only other artifacts, so authors point such a step at the last planning artifact and state the real ordering in prose. spek rendered the declared graph faithfully, which put those steps on `apply`'s own level, reading as its peers — in `superpowers-bridge` that placed `verify` beside `apply`, inviting exactly the mistake the schema's own runtime precheck exists to block.

- **A step that follows implementation is drawn after `apply`, on a dashed edge captioned as spek's inference.** The ordering is derived from the `requires` graph — an artifact outside everything `apply` needs, whose own dependencies cover all of them — and the edge is never drawn like a declared one, because `openspec status` does not block on it. Of the 88 OpenSpec schemas discoverable on GitHub, 18 declare such a step; the rule is a no-op on every built-in schema, and about 82% precise across everything it flags, which is why it announces itself rather than asserting an ordering. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#48](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/48))
- **`apply` is a real node in the flow now**, so the steps after it hang off it and `archive` follows the tail rather than sitting beside it. A schema that declares an artifact literally *named* `apply` — `superspec` does, as an implementation receipt — no longer collapses into the apply phase: both are separate, selectable steps drawn in the schema's own vocabulary
- **A derived edge is explained once, and never erases a dependency the CLI enforces.** Where a declared path already implies the ordering, the derived edge is dropped instead of repeating the explanation on every step below it; where the reverse held, an inference used to imply a real `requires` away, leaving a node whose only incoming line said "openspec does not block on this"
- **An edge no longer detours through the node it exists to go around.** Two edges converging on one step were ordered by the other end's column alone, so a tie put the long way round on the inside slot — and with the curve forced there it swung wide enough to be drawn straight through `apply`
- **Every line in the diagram is visible in both themes.** Edges, arrowheads, the archive step's dashed outline and both legend swatches were drawn in the panel-hairline colour — **1.22:1 dark and 1.13:1 light**, at full strength, so no opacity of it could have helped. In this diagram a line is not decoration: an arrow is the only thing stating that `specs` depends on `proposal`, and a dash is the only non-colour cue separating *declared* from *derived* from *not declared by this schema*. They now measure 5.52:1 and 5.17:1
- **A selected step's `generates` label is readable.** Over the accent wash a selected step draws, it measured 4.45:1 in the light theme — under the floor, in the ordinary case of selecting a step that produces a file
- **A graph node's label stays readable whichever node is drawn next to it.** The halo behind each label was painted inside its own node's group, so it survived a collision with the nodes drawn before it and was painted over by the ones drawn after — the protection held in one direction only, at no cost to any colour, which is why nothing measurable saw it
- **An OpenSpec installation that cannot answer the artifact-order query stops costing a process start per change.** A refusal about one change is still never held against the schema every other change shares, but it is now remembered against the change it was about — so an `openspec` too old for `status --change --json` is asked once per change instead of on every open and every watcher-driven refresh

## 1.14.0

**Highlight: the light theme is readable.** The webview follows VS Code's theme, so this is what a reader gets rather than a mode they chose, and nearly every colour in the light one failed WCAG AA. An error message measured 2.76:1; the spec diff's added lines 1.70:1, sitting directly beside removed lines that were merely bad. The dark theme was audited on the same terms and carried two failures of its own.

- **Error, success and warning colours are now defined per theme.** Each was one shade applied to both, and none of them reaches even 3:1 on a light background — the spec diff's added and removed lines, every page's error message and the jj conflict badge all failed there
- **Secondary text is readable in both themes.** Timestamps, counts and empty states measured 2.34:1 light and 3.54:1 dark
- **Links, the active sidebar item and search highlighting** take a deeper amber in the light theme; the previous one was 3.04:1 as text and 3.50:1 behind a search hit's tint
- **A completed task no longer fades its own links and code spans.** The row carried 60% opacity, which composites everything beneath it — its body text measured 3.24:1 dark and 2.77:1 light. Completion is marked by colour now, with the strikethrough and checkmark unchanged
- **The task progress bar's complete state is distinguishable from its track** — 2.02:1 before, in the light theme
- **The graph and the timeline follow the theme.** Node fills, legend swatches and the archived timeline bars were hard-coded colours no theme could reach; the graph's spec nodes measured 1.85:1 on a light page and its archived nodes 2.93:1 in the dark one. Edges are now drawn in a colour that can be seen, labels carry a halo where they overlap a node, and the "today" marker is at full strength
- **A CLI failure is no longer remembered for the full cache window.** An unreachable `openspec` binary meant 30 seconds of "unavailable" even after `PATH` was fixed — which is how this was reported, from a host that resolves the user's shell `PATH` at startup ([#46](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/46))
- **Building from source works on Windows.** `@spekjs/core` and `@spekjs/ui` used Unix-only `rm -rf` / `cp` in their build scripts, so `npm run build` failed under `cmd.exe`. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#47](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/47))

## 1.13.1

**Highlight: the rule beside an open section now starts and ends where its content does.** 1.13.0 gave each requirement its own rule and a gap between them, but the rule was drawn down the section's *box* — and a box holds two spaces its content does not (issue #42).

- **The rule starts at its heading, not 20px above it.** That space is also what separates a section from the one before it, so of the 28px between two requirements, 20px was drawn as rule — 1.13.0's gap was real but invisible, and a page of requirements still read as one interrupted line with a notch in it
- **And it ends at the last of its content**, instead of running past it. The trailing space below a section's last paragraph sits inside the box too, so the rule overshot the thing it was marking by a further 20px — plainest under the last scenario of a requirement
- **An open requirement's heading no longer sits 1px right of a closed one's.** The rule used to be a border, which inset everything inside an open section; drawn as its own element it does not. Headings and disclosure arrows now line up down the page regardless of open state
- **The rule stays visible in Windows high contrast**, where the previous drawing method would have been discarded
- A scenario written with no requirement above it now takes a top-level section's spacing, 4px lower than before: how much room a section leaves above its heading follows its nesting, not its heading level

## 1.13.0

**Highlight: a requirement is now called what it is named.** Every requirement heading in a spec opened with the word `Requirement:` and every scenario with `Scenario:` — the same twelve characters at the front of every heading in the document, taken from exactly where a reader scans for what distinguishes one from the next (issue #42).

- **Requirement and scenario headings drop their format keyword**, in the rendered spec, in the table of contents, and in the sidebar's Specs tree — so the panel and the sidebar agree on what a heading is called. Presentation only: your files, every heading id and every deep link are untouched, and a sidebar heading keeps the authored text in its tooltip, so the format stays one hover away
- **The rule beside an open section now marks that section.** Consecutive requirements drew rules that met, forming a single unbroken line down the whole page: a bracket around everything says the same as no bracket at all. Each requirement now carries its own, ending where the requirement ends. A nested open scenario no longer draws a second rule of equal weight beside its parent's
- **Expanding a scenario no longer nudges the rest of the page.** The gap between sections depended on what the last visible element inside one happened to be, so opening a scenario pushed every requirement below it down by a further 8px
- **A little more room around the fold** — the body sits further from the rule, and the disclosure arrow is no longer drawn against it

## 1.12.0

**Highlight: spek now shows the workflow itself, not just its output.** A schema decides what a change *is* in OpenSpec — which artifacts exist, what order they come in, what each is supposed to contain, and when the change is ready to implement. Until now it appeared only as a small badge on a change that differed from the workspace default: a name with nothing behind it.

- **New Schemas page** listing every workflow schema available to the workspace, with its description, its source (shipped with the `openspec` package, or project-local under `openspec/schemas/`), and how many artifacts it defines. The schema named by `openspec/config.yaml` is marked as the default, and each schema shows how many active changes declare it, with a link through to them. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen)
- **A schema detail view that reads as a workflow** — its artifacts in authoritative order as a diagram, each showing the file it generates, what it requires before it can be written, and its full instruction text. The `apply` step is drawn as the flow's terminal step
- **When the OpenSpec CLI cannot answer, the page says so.** If the CLI is missing, exits non-zero, times out, or emits something unparsable, the list comes back empty *with the reason stated*, rather than as an unexplained empty page
- **Spec content is now ranked by structure rather than by inherited type size.** In a change's Specs tab the spec's own name was smaller than the `ADDED Requirements` label inside it, so a reader scrolled past the boundary between two stacked specs without registering that one occurred. The topic name is now the dominant heading of its section, the operation label is demoted, and an open section is inset with a hairline rule marking where it ends (issue #42)
- **Every delta operation is marked, not an arbitrary two.** `REMOVED` and `RENAMED` had no styling of their own, so in prose they read as ordinary words. `REMOVED` deliberately does not take red: red already means "normative" (`MUST` / `SHALL`) here

## 1.11.0

**Highlight: a spec opens as an outline with substance, instead of a wall of text.** Reported as "you are asked to read all these fine details, but you don't even really know the shape of the thing first" (issue #42).

- **Requirements and scenarios fold in place.** Each `### Requirement:` shows its heading *and* its lead SHALL paragraph; each `#### Scenario:` shows as a heading with its WHEN/THEN body collapsed. Scenario blocks are 59% of the character volume in this repo's own specs — so the first screen becomes a contents page that still says what each requirement requires. Expand all / Collapse all is available, and your choice is remembered
- **Find-in-page still finds folded text, and links still land.** Folding uses the browser's native disclosure elements rather than hiding content with CSS, so the webview's find reaches text inside a collapsed scenario. The `spek.navigateTo` command with a `#hash` expands whatever encloses the target heading before scrolling, so a jump from the sidebar never arrives at something invisible
- **Folding applies only to spec-shaped content** — the spec detail page and a change's Specs tab. Proposal, design and other markdown artifacts render unfolded exactly as before
- **Every BDD keyword is legible in the light theme.** WHEN / THEN / SHALL and the rest were hard-coded to one set of colours shared by both themes, and against the light background all 8 failed WCAG AA — 7 below even 3:1, with `THEN` at **1.43:1**. The dark theme passed everywhere, which is why this went unseen. Light now has its own values in the same hue families, clearing AA at 5.17–6.47:1; dark is unchanged byte for byte, and no hue or pill fill moves on either theme
- **A highlighted keyword no longer renders lighter than the emphasis around it.** A keyword inside `**bold**` was drawn at a lower font weight than the bold text containing it

## 1.10.1

- **A `tasks.md` whose lines don't end in a plain newline is counted correctly.** A file using carriage-return line endings — a legacy Mac export, or a stray `\r` left in front of a Windows one — had checkboxes silently skipped: they appeared as ordinary text and contributed nothing to the progress count, so the total was simply wrong with nothing on screen to explain it. Line endings now follow CommonMark, which counts a lone `\r` like any other (issue #33)
- **An invisible-whitespace line no longer truncates the task above it.** A line holding only a no-break space — what a paste from a word processor or a web page often leaves behind — was treated as a blank line, and a blank line ends a task's continuation: every sub-bullet and paragraph after it vanished from the Tasks tab, with the line that caused it invisible. Only spaces and tabs make a line blank now, as CommonMark defines it
- **Nothing moves for a `tasks.md` that uses ordinary newlines** — the overwhelming majority. Both fixes were verified against a reference Markdown renderer, and no progress bar or count changes

## 1.10.0

**Highlight: the Tasks tab shows what your `tasks.md` actually says.** Two independent defects had made it the least faithful view in the app — one discarded content before it ever reached the UI, the other displayed what survived as literal source. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for reporting and contributing both.

- **A task's continuation lines are no longer discarded.** Sub-bullets, explanatory paragraphs and code blocks written underneath a `- [ ]` item were dropped by the parser itself, so they were missing from the data rather than merely hidden by styling — no amount of scrolling, resizing or switching surface would reveal them. In this repo's own openspec that was 90 of 1137 tasks, each showing only its first line. They now display as the source describes
- **Task text renders as Markdown.** The Tasks tab was the one artifact view whose text never reached a Markdown parser, so `**bold**` appeared as four asterisks and `` `code` `` as backticks around the word. Inline formatting, links, nested lists and code blocks now render as they do on every other tab. Links open in a new tab, matching the rest of the viewer
- **A bullet at column 0 after a checkbox stays outside that task.** A plain `- Note: …` line following a `- [ ]` item is a separate bullet in Markdown, and is now shown as one instead of being absorbed into the task above it as a nested list. The same applies to a heading, blockquote, code fence, numbered item or `---` — indent any of them and it still belongs to the task, exactly as Markdown reads it
- **Progress counts, section grouping and the CI task badge are unchanged.** Only checkboxes at column 0 are counted, as before; an indented `- [ ]` belongs to its parent task's text and is not a task of its own. This was verified across every `tasks.md` in this repo — no progress bar or badge value moves

## 1.9.2

- **Spec diffs stay readable on lines too wide to fit.** The red and green tints marking removed and added lines stopped at the first screenful, so scrolling right — exactly what you do to read a long line — left the changed text sitting on plain background, with nothing to say whether it was an addition or a removal. The tints now span the full scrollable width. Thanks to [@Katsz](https://github.com/Katsz) (Alex) for reporting and contributing this
- **The `··· N lines hidden ···` marker stays in view while you scroll a diff sideways.** Its label was centred against the diff's full width rather than the visible area, so on a wide diff it sat off-screen and the collapsed region looked like an unexplained gap. The label is now pinned to the left edge, the way a diff hunk header behaves

## 1.9.1

- **The timeline's "group by topic" works when worktree aggregation is on** (`spek.aggregateWorktrees`, on by default). Every change landed in the "(no topic)" lane, which read as though the repo had no spec relationships at all. Nothing looked broken — the chart rendered exactly as it does when the grouping is genuinely empty. Repos with a single worktree were unaffected (issue #25)

## 1.9.0

**Highlight: Jujutsu (jj) workspace aggregation (experimental)** — spek can now see OpenSpec changes in jj workspaces, not just git worktrees. In a colocated git+jj repo, jj workspaces are invisible to `git worktree list`, so changes authored there used to be silently missed. This is **experimental and off by default** — enable `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` to opt in. Thanks to [@DannyGoodall](https://github.com/DannyGoodall) (Danny Goodall) for contributing this.

- When enabled, and a repo has jj initialised and the `jj` CLI is available, spek also discovers OpenSpec changes in every jj workspace and merges them into the same aggregated view as git worktrees
- The colocated main directory (both a git worktree and the jj `default` workspace) is deduplicated by path, so it is never double-counted
- Because jj workspaces share one commit graph (each materialises the full trunk), a shared change would otherwise appear once per workspace; jj changes are deduplicated by content, so a shared change is shown once. A workspace that has diverged on a change keeps its own entry, flagged "conflicts with &lt;base&gt;" (and "editing" if it's the `@` change)
- Opt in via the VS Code setting `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` (**experimental, off by default**), independent of git worktree aggregation
- Degrades gracefully: when disabled, or `jj` is not installed, or the repo is not a jj repo, behaviour is identical to before — `jj` is never required

**The aggregation scope is now one control in the panel header.** It used to be a checkbox on the Changes page, which meant it only existed on that page even though it changes what the Dashboard, Graph and Timeline show as well. It is now a single control in the header — `Current dir` / `Worktrees` / `Worktrees + jj` — visible from every page, and it appears only when there is more than one working copy to aggregate.

- The three states are mutually exclusive, so the meaningless combination "don't aggregate, but do include jj" can no longer be selected. The `Worktrees + jj` option is offered only when a jj workspace is actually detected
- The control writes the settings, not a hidden preference: it edits `spek.aggregateWorktrees` and `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` in your workspace `settings.json`, and editing those settings by hand updates the control
- **New setting: `spek.aggregateWorktrees`** (default on) — git worktree aggregation was previously always on and not configurable

## 1.8.3

- **Lists with blank lines between their items render correctly again.** Every bullet and number was pushed onto its own line, above the text it belonged to, which made proposals and task lists hard to scan. Markers now sit inline with the first line of their item. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for reporting and contributing this.

## 1.8.2

- **Opening a change is much faster.** Each change took about a second to open. To order a change's tabs, spek asks the OpenSpec CLI for the artifact order that the change's schema defines — and it repeated that request for every change, even though every change sharing a schema gets the same answer back. The answer is now looked up once per schema instead of once per change, so only the first change you open pays for it and the rest open immediately. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for contributing this.

## 1.8.1

- **Changes shared across git worktrees no longer show up multiple times.** When you work in several worktrees of one repo, each inherits a copy of every open change; spek was listing every copy, cluttering the Changes list and the dependency Graph, and inflating each spec's fan-in count in the graph. It now shows one entry per change — the copy from the worktree actually editing it — decided from git history (which worktree has advanced the change past the main worktree) rather than file timestamps as the primary signal; timestamps now only break a tie between copies that have *both* genuinely advanced. Because a fresh worktree rewrites every file's timestamp on checkout, the old timestamp-first guess could pick an idle, never-touched copy and make an in-progress change look reset to zero; that no longer happens. Thanks to [@david-lutz](https://github.com/david-lutz) (David Lutz) for contributing this.

## 1.8.0

- **The Refresh button now actually refreshes.** The circular-arrow button at the bottom of the sidebar — previously labelled "Resync" — only rebuilt an internal cache. It never re-fetched what was on screen, so if you edited a file and pressed it, nothing happened; you had to navigate away and back before your change showed up. It now re-fetches, and it keeps spinning until the new data has actually arrived instead of stopping before it lands (which made a working refresh look like a broken one). Thanks to [@deniskrizanovic](https://github.com/deniskrizanovic) for reporting.

## 1.7.0

- **spek has moved to the `spekhq` GitHub organization** — the repository is now [`spekhq/spek`](https://github.com/spekhq/spek), and the live demo moved to [`spekhq.github.io/spek`](https://spekhq.github.io/spek/demo.html). Links from the marketplace listing and from older versions redirect automatically.
- No other user-facing changes for the extension in this release.

## 1.6.1

- **TOC navigation lands on the section you clicked** — clicking a table-of-contents entry, or opening a `#hash` deep link, on a Change or Spec detail page no longer scrolls the target heading behind the sticky header, which made it look like the click had jumped one section too far. The offset is now measured from the header that is actually rendered instead of an assumed 80px, and the entry you clicked is the one the TOC highlights.
- **Schema badge under worktree aggregation** — when changes are aggregated across worktrees, each change's schema is now compared against the default schema of the worktree it actually lives in, rather than the main worktree's. A change that uses its own worktree's default no longer shows a badge, and the list and detail views agree on this. Scanning also reads each worktree's `openspec/config.yaml` once instead of once per change.

Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for both.

## 1.6.0

- No user-facing changes for the VS Code extension in this release.

## 1.5.0

- **Custom OpenSpec schemas** — a change's artifacts are now discovered from disk, so a change authored under any schema (not just the built-in `spec-driven`) renders every artifact as its own tab. Previously anything outside `proposal` / `design` / `tasks` / `specs` was silently dropped. Full-text search now indexes every markdown artifact as well.
- **Artifact tab ordering** — tabs default to last-modified order so the artifact you're actively editing surfaces first. A sort control adds **Schema order** (sourced from the OpenSpec CLI, degrading gracefully to the default order when the CLI is unavailable or the change is archived) and **A–Z**. The choice persists across changes.
- **Schema badge** — each change's schema is shown as a badge on the Changes list, the Dashboard, and Change Detail. It is hidden when the change uses the repo's default schema (from `openspec/config.yaml`), so a badge always means "this change uses a non-default schema"; the Changes page states the repo default as a plain-text label.

Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for contributing all of the above.

## 1.4.0

- Live-reload now works inside devcontainers and WSL. On filesystems that don't deliver native OS change events (9p / drvfs / NFS / CIFS / FUSE), spek automatically falls back to polling — so files created or edited after opening it are still detected. Detection is based on the watched path's filesystem type and needs no configuration; an optional `SPEK_WATCH_POLLING=on|off` escape hatch exists only if you ever need to force it. Applies to the Web, VS Code, and IntelliJ live variants. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for contributing this feature.

## 1.3.4

- Fix: the Timeline no longer falls back to "No timeline data" when a change's `created:` date is set correctly. The IntelliJ plugin's backend never read `created:` from `.openspec.yaml` (so every change lost its created date on the Timeline), and the Web / VS Code parser dropped `created:` from files saved with CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings. Both backends now surface `createdDate` and `archivedDate` consistently, and the Timeline empty state no longer wrongly claims the `created:` field is missing.

## 1.3.3

- Fix: the IntelliJ plugin now installs on IntelliJ Platform 2026.1 (build 261.x) and newer — the `until-build` upper bound (`253.*`) that caused "requires IDE build 253.* or earlier" has been removed, so the plugin tracks current and future IDE releases (#4)
- Update the published `kewang/spek` GitHub Action off the deprecated Node 20 runtime — bump `actions/checkout` to v7, `actions/setup-node` to v6, and `actions/cache` to v6; internal CI workflows and README examples updated to match (#7)

## 1.3.2

- Update VS Code Marketplace keywords/tags for better discoverability — replace `bdd` with `sdd`, add `spec-driven-development` and `ai`, and drop `documentation` / `viewer`

## 1.3.1

- Fix: a fresh clone now starts cleanly with `npm install && npm run dev` — `@spek/core` resolves to its gitignored `dist/` build, which neither install nor dev used to produce, so the Express API failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and Vite failed to resolve `@spek/core/headings`. `npm install` now compiles `@spek/core` (new `prepare` script) and the root `dev` script rebuilds it before launching (#2)

## 1.3.0

**Highlight: Cross-worktree aggregation** — when you run agents in parallel across multiple git worktrees, spek now shows the OpenSpec content of *all* worktrees in one place, instead of forcing you to point spek at each worktree by hand.

- Point spek at any directory and it auto-discovers every git worktree of the same repo, then merges their active changes, archived changes, and the spec-change graph into a single unified view
- Each change card / row is tagged with its source worktree branch, so you can tell at a glance which worktree a change lives in
- A toggle turns aggregation off to view only the current directory
- Active changes from each worktree coexist (same-named slugs are both shown, identified by their source worktree); archived changes are deduped by slug; the specs list always comes from the main worktree
- Aggregation is the default whenever multiple worktrees are detected — single-worktree or non-git repos behave exactly as before
- Supported in the Web version and the VS Code extension (IntelliJ and Demo are unchanged)
- Fix: the VS Code extension now uses chokidar for file watching, so newly created nested directories (e.g. a change's `specs/<topic>/spec.md`) are detected and the change-detail spec tab live-reloads correctly

## 1.2.0

- Add `/timeline` page: horizontal Gantt-style chart of every change's lifecycle — active bars extend to today with an arrow, archived bars render as fixed segments
- Timeline supports an optional "Group by topic" toggle and "Hide active / Hide archived" filter chips, plus an auto-scaling time axis (daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly ticks based on span)
- Read `created:` from `.openspec.yaml` and derive `archivedDate` from archive folder name; surface lifecycle info in `ChangeInfo` / `ChangeDetail` (server payload adds two backwards-compatible fields)
- ChangeList row shows `Created Apr 20 · 5d ago` for active changes and `Created Feb 14 → Archived Feb 22 · 8d` for archived ones
- ChangeDetail header gains a lifecycle banner (e.g., `Created 2026-02-14 · Archived 2026-02-22 (8 days)` or `Active for 5 days`)
- Dashboard adds two stats cards: **Avg lifecycle (archived)** and **Stale active (>30d)**
- VS Code sidebar shows lifecycle days in change descriptions and includes the created date in tooltips
- New `@spek/web` test runner (`npm test -w @spek/web`) covers the timeline scale and grouping helpers

## 1.1.0

- Add table-of-contents (TOC) sidebar to spec detail pages — sticky navigation lists all `h2`/`h3` headings, with scrollspy highlighting and smooth scrolling on click
- Add TOC sidebar to change detail pages for the Proposal, Design, and Specs tabs (Tasks tab excluded); TOC updates when switching tabs
- Persist the active tab in the change detail URL (`?tab=<id>`) and support deep links with both tab + hash (e.g., `?tab=design#decision-1`)
- Specs tab: prefix each delta spec's heading ids with `<topic>--` so multiple specs with the same heading text no longer collide
- Support URL hash anchors on spec detail pages (e.g., `/specs/foo#requirement-bar` scrolls to that heading)
- Expand spec items in the VS Code sidebar to reveal their headings as child nodes; clicking a heading opens the webview at the corresponding section
- Add `extractHeadings` and `slugifyHeading` utilities to `@spek/core` for shared heading parsing across web and extension hosts
