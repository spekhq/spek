/**
 * Discover a change directory's artifacts from disk. It builds one artifact per root file and one for a
 * non-empty specs tree, then sorts by mtime, newest first.
 *
 * The id-dedup precedence is: specs first, then root files in rootArtifacts order (markdown/tasks before
 * data). So a root specs.md becomes specs-2, spec.md keeps "spec", and spec.json becomes spec-2. This
 * order decides the ids only. The display order is the mtime sort at the end.
 *
 * A root file takes its own mtime. specs takes the newest mtime of its delta files. So an artifact edited
 * during a run (for example tasks) moves to the front. Two artifacts tie only when their mtime is exactly
 * equal (for example, written in the same second). The tiebreak is then the default order (DEFAULT_ORDER
 * first, then alphabetical). Note that git clone and git checkout usually write a different sub-ms mtime
 * per file. So this default (Last modified) mode does not guarantee the proposal, design, ... narrative
 * order for a fresh, unedited checkout. For authored order, use the frontend Schema order or A-Z. This
 * does not call the openspec CLI and does not parse any schema.
