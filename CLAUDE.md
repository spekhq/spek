# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo.

## Project Overview

spek — an OpenSpec content viewer. Four delivery surfaces plus one CI helper:

- **Web** — local read-only Express + React SPA; pick a repo path in the UI and browse
- **VS Code** — Webview Panel over the current workspace's openspec
- **IntelliJ** — Tool Window + JCEF
- **Demo** — self-contained static HTML (`docs/demo.html`) embedding spek's own openspec, deployed to GitHub Pages
- **GitHub Action** (`spekhq/spek`) — generates an HTML snapshot + status badges in CI

## Repo

The repo is **`spekhq/spek`**; the npm scope is **`@spekjs`** (an org name ≠ npm scope is normal — don't "fix" the mismatch).

## action.yml: zero test coverage — read before touching the build chain

The composite action is the only shipped artifact with **no test coverage** (`npm test` and CI never run it — a
known trade-off). **Any change to packaging build timing / the build chain must verify the action manually**: add a
temporary `workflow_dispatch` workflow with `uses: spekhq/spek@master` + `generate-badges: "true"`, assert that
`html-path` / `badges-path` actually produce files, then remove it.

- Precedent: moving `@spekjs/ui`'s build from `prepare` (install-time) to `prepublishOnly` (publish-time) made the
  action's ui build **silently vanish** — it relied on `npm ci` triggering `prepare` to get ui dist. The Marketplace
  action was broken for a full day with nothing raising an alarm.
- `spek-version` defaults to `"master"` — a user who pins `@v1` still builds against master: master breaks → everyone
  breaks instantly.

## Tech Stack

- **`@spekjs/core`** — pure Node.js shared logic (scanner / tasks / types). Published to npm on its own version line;
  only runtime dep is `cross-spawn`. In-repo consumers resolve it locally via `"*"` workspaces, so development is
  independent of core's release cadence.
- **`@spekjs/ui`** — reusable visual components (`SpecGraph`, `ChangeTimeline`). Published to npm. **Purely
  presentational**: data in via props, selection out via callbacks; no router / adapter / CSS framework. Colors are 8
  `--spek-*` CSS variables (its own names, never the host's tokens). The web `/graph` and `/timeline` pages are thin
  shells (fetch / loading / navigation / theme).
- React 19 + Vite + TS + Tailwind v4; Express (REST); VS Code Webview + esbuild; IntelliJ Kotlin + JCEF + built-in
  server; react-markdown + remark-gfm (BDD highlighting); search = server-side full-text + Fuse.js; React Router v7
  (Web BrowserRouter / webview MemoryRouter).

## Architecture

### `@spekjs/core`

Pure functions + types, shared by the web server and extension hosts. **Scanning never calls the CLI.** Authoritative
behavior lives in `openspec/specs/`; the key entry points:

- `scanOpenSpec(basePath)` — scan a single directory
- `scanOpenSpecAggregated(basePath, {aggregate, includeJj})` — cross-worktree aggregation. Active changes are deduped
  by slug, **dispatched by VCS**: **git worktrees** via a **git-divergence election** (winning copy is the one advanced
  past `main`'s HEAD, `main` competing on equal terms, mtime tiebreak); **jj workspaces** (EXPERIMENTAL — `includeJj`,
  off by default) via a **content fingerprint** — because jj workspaces share one commit graph and materialise the full
  trunk, identical copies collapse to one, a diverged copy is kept and flagged `conflictsWith`, and the `@`-edited one
  is flagged `isCurrent`. jj entries are **never** fed into the git election (their `head` is a jj change-id, not a git
  ref). Archived deduped by slug, specs from the main worktree. Single worktree / non-git / aggregation off →
  `scanOpenSpec`. `buildGraphDataAggregated` uses the same dual-path logic
- `readChange(basePath, slug, orderProvider?)` — returns `ChangeDetail`: disk-discovered `artifacts` (mtime order),
  `schema` / `defaultSchema` (that worktree's default, read from `openspec/config.yaml` once per worktree; the badge is
  hidden when a change's schema == its own `defaultSchema`), and `schemaOrder` (see below)
- `discoverArtifacts(changePath)` / `countArtifacts` — discover artifacts from the filesystem (each root `*.md` + a
  non-empty `specs/`, classified `markdown` / `tasks` / `specs`). mtime newest-first, with a stable tiebreak on ties
  (`proposal, design, specs, tasks` first, then alphabetical)
- `readSpec` / `readSpecAtChange`, `buildGraphData` / `buildGraphDataAggregated` (aggregated node ids
  `change:<wtKey>:<slug>` avoid collisions), `listWorktrees`, `parseTasks`
- **jj workspace support (EXPERIMENTAL)**: `listJjWorkspaces(dir)` (`jj workspace list`),
  `listWorkspaces(dir, {includeJj})` (merges git worktrees + jj workspaces, dedups the colocated main by path — git
  entry wins to keep the branch), `jjCurrentChangeSlugs(dir)` (`jj diff --ignore-working-copy -r @`, read-only, drives
  `isCurrent`). All degrade to `[]`/empty when `jj` is absent — `jj` is **never required**. Off by default; opt in via
  `includeJj` (Web `jj` query param) or the VS Code `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` setting. `WorktreeInfo.vcs` and
  `ChangeInfo.isCurrent` / `.conflictsWith` carry the jj metadata
- `extractHeadings` / `slugifyHeading` (h2/h3 → stable slugs for the spec TOC and VS Code sidebar; **import from the
  `@spekjs/core/headings` subpath** so the webview bundle doesn't pull in server-only modules)
- `ChangeDetail.artifacts: ChangeArtifact[]` is the contract across core / API / frontends, driving both tabs and TOC
  (markdown / specs have a TOC, tasks doesn't)

**schema-order cache**: `schemaOrder` comes from the CLI (`openspec status --change <slug> --json`), queried **once,
only when a change detail is read** — never on the scan hot path. The authoritative order depends only on the schema,
so the cache is keyed `${repoRoot}::${schema}` (all changes sharing a schema share it, spawning the CLI at most once —
issue #15). A change whose schema name doesn't resolve locally **still gets queried** (the CLI returns a built-in
default), sharing a sentinel bucket `${repoRoot}::\0default`. **The only early null is an empty slug**; it's also null
when the CLI is unavailable / for archived changes, and the frontend falls back to narrative order with a reason.

**Frontend artifact sort**: preference in `localStorage["spek:artifact-sort"]` — `modified` (mtime, default) /
`schema` (`schemaOrder`) / `alpha` (title).

**Polling fallback**: inotify doesn't deliver events on 9p/drvfs/NFS/CIFS mounts (devcontainer/WSL), so the decision is
by the watched path's fstype (`decidePolling` precedence: explicit override `SPEK_WATCH_POLLING` /
`CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING` → fstype detection (`/proc/mounts`) → remote-env fallback). Web/VS Code pass chokidar
`usePolling`; IntelliJ has a Kotlin-aligned `WatchPolling.kt`.

### API Adapter

`ApiAdapter` abstracts transport, injected via `ApiAdapterContext`: `FetchAdapter` (Web + IntelliJ, configurable
`baseUrl` / `dirParam`), `MessageAdapter` (VS Code `postMessage`), `StaticAdapter` (Demo `window.__DEMO_DATA__`).

### API endpoints (Web; all openspec routes accept `dir`)

`/changes`, `/overview`, `/graph`, `/watch` also accept `aggregate` (default true) and `jj` (**EXPERIMENTAL, default false**; `jj=true` includes jj workspaces). `/changes/:slug` accepts `wt` (source working directory, incl. jj workspaces).

```
GET /api/fs/browse?path=...                        # directory browse
GET /api/fs/detect?path=...                         # detect openspec/
GET /api/openspec/overview?dir=...&aggregate=       # overview stats
GET /api/openspec/specs?dir=...                     # spec list
GET /api/openspec/specs/:topic?dir=...              # single spec
GET /api/openspec/specs/:topic/at/:slug?dir=...     # spec at a change (diff)
GET /api/openspec/changes?dir=...&aggregate=        # changes list
GET /api/openspec/changes/:slug?dir=...&wt=         # single change
GET /api/openspec/graph?dir=...&aggregate=          # spec-change graph
GET /api/openspec/search?dir=...&q=...              # full-text search
```

### VS Code Extension

- commands: `spek.open` / `spek.search` / `spek.navigateTo` (the last accepts a route with a `#hash`)
- activation: `workspaceContains:openspec/config.yaml`; the Webview loads the IIFE-bundled React app; the extension host calls `@spekjs/core` directly
- Sidebar Specs TreeView: each spec expands into its h2/h3 headings; clicking one jumps to the matching webview anchor

### IntelliJ Plugin

- Kotlin + IntelliJ Platform SDK; JCEF loads the React SPA; the built-in server exposes REST (`/api/spek/openspec/*`, `projectPath` param)
- Kotlin re-implements the core scan/read logic (`core/` dir): `ArtifactDiscovery.kt`, `SchemaOrder.kt`, aligned with the TS rules; tests in `src/test/kotlin`
- The frontend uses `FetchAdapter` (custom `baseUrl` + `dirParam`) against the embedded server
- **Tool Window layout + hideable tree**: a `JBSplitter` (top: Specs/Changes tree, bottom: JCEF). `JBSplitter` not
  `JSplitPane`: when a child is `isVisible=false` it gives all space to the other side and hides the divider, and
  `proportionKey` persists the ratio automatically. The tree's visibility toggles via `ToggleTreePanelAction` (one
  action instance on both the title bar and the ⋮ gear menu). The preference lives in `SpekProjectState.treeVisible`
  (`PersistentStateComponent` → `.idea/workspace.xml`); **`hasOpenSpec` is deliberately kept out of `State`**, else a
  project that removed `openspec/` would misjudge on reopen. While the tree is hidden, `TreeRefreshGate` (pure logic,
  unit-testable) records refreshes as pending and rebuilds once before re-showing
- Theme sync: JCEF `executeJavaScript()` injects a CSS class; file watching: VFS BulkFileListener + 500ms debounce

**Frontend routes**: `/` (SelectRepo, web only) → `/dashboard` → `/specs` → `/specs/:topic` → `/changes` → `/changes/:slug` → `/graph`

## Key Design Decisions

- **Security**: Express only reads `.md` / `.yaml` files under `openspec/`; no arbitrary file access
- **BDD highlighting**: WHEN/GIVEN (blue), THEN (green), AND (gray), MUST/SHALL (red), ADDED/MODIFIED (orange/blue badge)
- **Dark theme**: bg #0a0c0f family, accent amber #f59e0b, text #e2e8f0
- **tasks.md parsing**: `- [x]` / `- [ ]` + `##` sections → `{ total, completed, sections }`
- **Webview CSP**: IIFE + nonce script + unsafe-inline styles (Tailwind needs it)
- **Host flags**: VS Code sets `window.__vscodeApi` (`acquireVsCodeApi` called once, stored globally), IntelliJ
  `window.__spekIntellij`, Demo `window.__DEMO_DATA__`. `useFileWatcher` picks its refresh channel from these flags, so
  **every non-Web host must have its own flag** — IntelliJ once lacked one, was mistaken for Web, and opened an
  EventSource on `/api/openspec/watch`; the built-in server only serves `/api/spek/`, so that path 404s and it
  reconnects forever
- **Refresh**: `refresh(manual)` arms the busy state only on a manual refresh (a spinner appearing on an auto refresh
  is noise); busy lasts until the refetched data actually arrives, not when the resync POST returns (`refreshTracker`
  distinguishes fetches by generation, with a 500ms timeout guard). The state machine is pure logic and unit-testable
- **Refresh invariant**: a resync (cache-invalidation) failure **must not block the refetch** — it's best-effort,
  enforced in the single spot `runManualRefresh` (one 404 from IntelliJ's missing resync route once made the whole
  button go dead — issue #18). resync means "invalidate stale server-side state this host actually holds": Web/VS Code
  clear the git-timestamp cache, IntelliJ has no such cache (`timestamp` is always null) so it clears the schema-order cache
- **live-status**: `liveStatus` (live/offline/unsupported) only speaks up when `offline` — no always-on "everything's
  fine" light (an always-lit light is noise and dulls the real signal). VS Code/IntelliJ have no observable failure
  signal, so they always report `live` (lying `offline` is worse than not reporting)

## Conventions

- **English is the single source of truth for everything committed to the repo**: code, comments, `openspec/`
  artifacts, `docs/`, community files. The maintainer may think/draft in Traditional Chinese, but the version committed
  is finalized in English by an agent (or written in English directly). **Single source of truth ≠ English-only
  reading**: reading in another language is served by on-the-fly translation, not a second copy in the repo (two copies
  drift). Exceptions: the README is bilingual (`README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md`); conversation with the user stays in
  Traditional Chinese (that's conversation, not a repo artifact). Existing Chinese comments needn't be back-translated
  wholesale; new ones are in English
- OpenSpec data structure: see the "OpenSpec data model" section in `docs/prd.md` (authoritative detail in `openspec/specs/`)
- **CHANGELOG (two version lines)**:
  - **The spek product** (Web / VS Code / IntelliJ share the root `package.json` version) is recorded in three
    CHANGELOGs — root + `packages/vscode` + `packages/intellij` — sharing one version history but **each filtering out
    entries irrelevant to that channel** (root is the superset; filter down from it)
  - **`@spekjs/core`** has its own version line and `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md`, **not written into the three above**
    (its readers are API consumers). It must be listed in core's `package.json` `files` (npm doesn't auto-pack a CHANGELOG)

## Workflow

- **Changes go through the OpenSpec workflow**: for a feature / fix / modification, create a change first (proposal →
  design → tasks), then implement. `/openspec-new-change` to create, `/openspec-verify-change` to verify,
  `/openspec-archive-change` to archive
- **Exception**: pure-docs changes that don't touch any spec under `openspec/specs/` (README / CONTRIBUTING / `docs/*` /
  community files) are committed directly, without a change
- **On archive**: update affected docs (CLAUDE.md / README, etc.) and create a git commit
```
