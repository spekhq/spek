# Changelog

## 1.18.1

Three fixes, two of them to the GitHub Action.

- **VS Code in a browser no longer opens a broken tab on every in-app click** ([#59](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/59)). In code-server, GitHub Codespaces and vscode.dev, clicking the sidebar's Overview / Specs / Changes, a change card or a spec link also opened a new browser tab at a 404 address, on top of the navigation that did happen inside the panel. VS Code forwards every link click in a webview to the workbench to open, even one the page already handled; desktop VS Code silently refuses those addresses, which is why the bug never showed there. In-app links now stay in the panel, external links still open as before, and the spec page's table of contents scrolls smoothly instead of jumping. Thanks to [@Philogag](https://github.com/Philogag) for reporting
- **The generated HTML snapshot survives content that looks like markup** ([#54](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/54)). An artifact containing `</script>` ended the page's data early, so the viewer never started and the rest of the data showed up as page text; an artifact containing `<!--` followed by `<script>` stopped the viewer from starting too. Both built without an error. The embedded data and the page title are now escaped, and the build fails, naming the part, if the page it assembled would not read back as written. This affects the GitHub Action's output and the live demo. Thanks to [@pierreboissinot](https://github.com/pierreboissinot) (Pierre Boissinot) for reporting and proposing the fix
- **The GitHub Action treats its inputs as text, never as shell commands** ([#56](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/56)). `repo-path`, `output-path` and `title` were pasted into the action's shell scripts, so a title such as `My "draft" specs` broke the build's arguments, and a workflow passing in an outside value (a PR title, a branch name) could have that value run as a command. They are now passed as data, and an `output-path` containing a newline is refused. **Behaviour change**: a value that relied on the shell expanding it, such as `output-path: $HOME/x.html`, now arrives literally; `${{ }}` expressions in your own workflow are unaffected. Users of `spekhq/spek@v1` receive this with this release

## 1.18.0

**Highlight: a keyword's casing is read the way OpenSpec reads it.** spek marked one casing rule across every keyword it highlights, and the keywords do not carry the same obligation. A scenario body is free text that no version of OpenSpec parses, so uppercase `WHEN` / `THEN` is a template convention — a spec written with `**Given**` / `**When**` / `**Then**` is perfectly valid and rendered with no highlighting at all. `SHALL` / `MUST` is the opposite: OpenSpec matches it case-sensitively and reports a requirement carrying no uppercase one. The rule is now decided per keyword group, against what OpenSpec actually does with each.

- **Title-case Gherkin steps are highlighted** ([#53](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/53)). `Given`, `When`, `Then` and `And` are marked when the whole emphasised run is the keyword — `**Given** a project is registered` — which is how such specs are written. Uppercase is unchanged
- **Ordinary prose is not marked.** A requirement beginning "When the server receives a request, it SHALL respond" marks only `SHALL`, as before. Recognising a step by its position instead was measured across 300 specs from 242 repositories and rejected: it marks that sentence, which every repository has, to reach the 2% that write title case
- **`MUST` / `SHALL` and the four delta operations stay uppercase-only.** Red means *normative* here and lowercase "must" is an ordinary verb; `**Modified**:` heads an impact list in many proposals and names no delta operation there
- **No keyword is highlighted inside a heading.** An emphasised one used to be — `## **ADDED** Requirements` showed a badge while the unemphasised form every spec actually uses did not
- **A requirement or scenario heading drops its keyword whatever the casing.** `### requirement: Foo` displays as `Foo`, in the rendered content and in every table of contents, as `### Requirement: Foo` already did. OpenSpec's own parser accepts the variant, so leaving the keyword visible showed formatting noise in place of the heading's name
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.13.0 changes `specHeadingLabel`'s behaviour on a heading whose keyword differs only in case

## 1.17.0

**Highlight: search finds what is actually there.** spek implemented search four times — the web server, the VS Code host, the IntelliJ server and the static build — and the four answered the same query differently. The web index scored an exact match out of the results once it sat more than about 40 characters into a file, so search was effectively blind past the first line of anything; the VS Code host carried a copy of the same defect. The rule is now stated once, and every surface runs it.

- **A term that appears verbatim is found, wherever it sits in the file** ([#51](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/51)). The fuzzy index ranked a match by its distance from the start of the document and discarded anything further in. Typo tolerance is gone with it: matching is now exact and case-insensitive, which is what the other two surfaces already did
- **Task text is searchable in the static build** ([#52](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/52)). The embedded tasks artifact carried only the parsed checklist, so every word the Tasks tab displays was invisible to search on the GitHub Action's output and the live demo
- **A change is found by its own name** — in the form the result card shows it, so a query copied off a result finds that result. Previously the web and VS Code surfaces matched file content only
- **One result per spec and per change**, taken from the file that actually contains the query. A term in three of a change's files used to list it three times, and a name match used to hand back a snippet with nothing the reader typed in it
- **Each result says which artifact answered and marks archived changes**, so a row explains itself even when there is nothing to highlight in it
- **Results are ordered the same way everywhere**, with the most recently archived change first rather than the oldest
- **A malformed search request is answered the same way by both servers.** IntelliJ treated a missing query as an empty one; a repeated `q` crashed the web route
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.12.0 exposes the rule on a browser-safe `@spekjs/core/search` subpath, with a shared fixture corpus holding the TypeScript and Kotlin implementations in agreement

## 1.16.0

**Highlight: a change's non-Markdown artifacts are visible.** A schema sets each artifact's filename through `generates:`, and not every artifact is Markdown — `event-driven` requires `asyncapi.yaml`. spek discovered only root `*.md` and the `specs/` tree, so such a change rendered every tab except the one its schema asks for.

- **Root `.yaml` / `.yml` / `.json` files are artifacts**, shown as syntax-highlighted text. The tab is named for the file's stem with a format badge, using the full filename only when a Markdown artifact shares it. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#50](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/50))
- **They sort into their schema position**, count in the change-list badge, are reachable by search, and refresh live on edit — on every surface
- **Discovery stays root-only and skips dotfiles**, so `.openspec.yaml` and subdirectory files never become tabs
- **Code fences in `proposal.md` / `design.md` are highlighted too.** A fence with no language stays plain
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.11.0 adds the `"data"` kind and the shared file listing behind count, search and discovery

## 1.15.0

**Highlight: the schema workflow diagram now says which steps come *after* implementation — and its lines can finally be seen.** OpenSpec has no way to declare "this artifact is produced once the change is implemented": an artifact's `requires` may name only other artifacts, so authors point such a step at the last planning artifact and state the real ordering in prose. spek rendered the declared graph faithfully, which put those steps on `apply`'s own level, reading as its peers — in `superpowers-bridge` that placed `verify` beside `apply`, inviting exactly the mistake the schema's own runtime precheck exists to block.

- **A step that follows implementation is drawn after `apply`, on a dashed edge captioned as spek's inference.** The ordering is derived from the `requires` graph — an artifact outside everything `apply` needs, whose own dependencies cover all of them — and the edge is never drawn like a declared one, because `openspec status` does not block on it. Of the 88 OpenSpec schemas discoverable on GitHub, 18 declare such a step; the rule is a no-op on every built-in schema, and about 82% precise across everything it flags, which is why it announces itself rather than asserting an ordering. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#48](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/48))
- **`apply` is a real node in the flow now**, so the steps after it hang off it and `archive` follows the tail rather than sitting beside it. A schema that declares an artifact literally *named* `apply` — `superspec` does, as an implementation receipt — no longer collapses into the apply phase: both are separate, selectable steps drawn in the schema's own vocabulary
- **A derived edge is explained once, and never erases a dependency the CLI enforces.** Where a declared path already implies the ordering, the derived edge is dropped instead of repeating the explanation on every step below it; where the reverse held, an inference used to imply a real `requires` away, leaving a node whose only incoming line said "openspec does not block on this"
- **An edge no longer detours through the node it exists to go around.** Two edges converging on one step were ordered by the other end's column alone, so a tie put the long way round on the inside slot — and with the curve forced there it swung wide enough to be drawn straight through `apply`
- **Every line in the diagram is visible in both themes.** Edges, arrowheads, the archive step's dashed outline and both legend swatches were drawn in the panel-hairline colour — **1.22:1 dark and 1.13:1 light**, at full strength, so no opacity of it could have helped. In this diagram a line is not decoration: an arrow is the only thing stating that `specs` depends on `proposal`, and a dash is the only non-colour cue separating *declared* from *derived* from *not declared by this schema*. They now measure 5.52:1 and 5.17:1
- **A selected step's `generates` label is readable.** Over the accent wash a selected step draws, it measured 4.45:1 in the light theme — under the floor, in the ordinary case of selecting a step that produces a file
- **A graph node's label stays readable whichever node is drawn next to it.** The halo behind each label was painted inside its own node's group, so it survived a collision with the nodes drawn before it and was painted over by the ones drawn after — the protection held in one direction only, at no cost to any colour, which is why nothing measurable saw it
- **An OpenSpec installation that cannot answer the artifact-order query stops costing a process start per change.** A refusal about one change is still never held against the schema every other change shares, but it is now remembered against the change it was about — so an `openspec` too old for `status --change --json` is asked once per change instead of on every open and every watcher-driven refresh
- **IntelliJ treats an unreadable CLI response as a failure, not as an answer.** An exit-0 run whose output could not be parsed was cached as "this schema has no order" for the full cache window
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.10.0 exposes the post-implementation derivation and the levelling behind it; `@spekjs/ui` 1.3.1 corrects the colour-contract documentation that shipped with 1.3.0

## 1.14.0

**Highlight: the light theme is readable.** It was never opt-in — `prefers-color-scheme` on the web, VS Code's theme, IntelliJ's — so it is what a reader gets rather than a mode they chose, and nearly every colour in it failed WCAG AA. An error message measured 2.76:1; the spec diff's added lines 1.70:1, sitting directly beside removed lines that were merely bad. The dark theme was audited on the same terms rather than assumed sound, and carried two failures of its own.

- **Error, success and warning colours are now defined per theme.** Each was one Tailwind shade applied to both, and no 400 shade in any family reaches even 3:1 on a light background — the spec diff's added and removed lines, every page's error message, the repo picker's detection states and the jj conflict badge all failed there
- **Secondary text is readable in both themes.** Timestamps, counts, empty states and the labels beside them measured 2.34:1 light and 3.54:1 dark
- **Links, the active sidebar item and search highlighting** take a deeper amber in the light theme. The previous one was 3.04:1 as plain text and 3.50:1 where a search hit sits on a tint of it — that tint, not the link, is what set the new value
- **A completed task no longer fades its own links and code spans.** The row carried 60% opacity, which composites everything beneath it: its body text measured 3.24:1 dark and 2.77:1 light, and no colour could have compensated because the fading happens after the colour is chosen. Completion is marked by colour now, with the strikethrough and checkmark unchanged
- **The task progress bar's complete state is distinguishable from its track** — 2.02:1 before, in the light theme
- **The graph and the timeline follow the theme.** Node fills, legend swatches and the archived timeline bars were hard-coded colours no theme could reach: the graph's spec nodes measured 1.85:1 on a light page, and its archived nodes 2.93:1 in the *dark* one, because that colour was a copy of a token that had since been corrected. Edges were drawn in the panel-border colour, which is 1.22:1 at full strength and cannot be seen at any opacity
- **Graph labels stay readable where they overlap a node**, and the timeline's "today" marker and both bar states are drawn at full strength instead of faded
- **A CLI failure is no longer remembered for the full cache window.** An unreachable `openspec` binary meant 30 seconds of "unavailable" even after `PATH` was fixed; a failure that resolves is now retried on the next read, while one the installed CLI reproduces identically is still cached ([#46](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/issues/46))
- **Building from source works on Windows.** `@spekjs/core` and `@spekjs/ui` used Unix-only `rm -rf` / `cp` in their build scripts, so `npm run build` failed under `cmd.exe`. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) ([#47](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/pull/47))

## 1.13.1

**Highlight: the rule beside an open section now starts and ends where its content does.** 1.13.0 gave each requirement its own rule and a gap between them, but the rule was drawn down the section's *box* — and a box holds two spaces its content does not. Reported from the IntelliJ tool window (issue #42), one round after the change that introduced the gap.

- **The rule starts at its heading, not 20px above it.** That space is also what separates a section from the one before it, so of the 28px between two requirements, 20px was drawn as rule — 1.13.0's gap was real but invisible, and a page of requirements still read as one interrupted line with a notch in it
- **And it ends at the last of its content**, instead of running past it. The trailing space below a section's last paragraph sits inside the box too, so the rule overshot the thing it was marking by a further 20px — plainest under the last scenario of a requirement
- **An open requirement's heading no longer sits 1px right of a closed one's.** The rule used to be a border, which inset everything inside an open section; drawn as its own element it does not. Headings and disclosure arrows now line up down the page regardless of open state
- **The rule stays visible in Windows high contrast**, where the previous drawing method would have been discarded
- A scenario written with no requirement above it now takes a top-level section's spacing, 4px lower than before: how much room a section leaves above its heading follows its nesting, not its heading level

## 1.13.0

**Highlight: a requirement is now called what it is named.** Every requirement heading in a spec opened with the word `Requirement:` and every scenario with `Scenario:` — the same twelve characters at the front of every heading in the document, taken from exactly where a reader scans for what distinguishes one from the next. Suggested from the IntelliJ tool window (issue #42), where a few hundred pixels of width makes the cost plainest.

- **Requirement and scenario headings drop their format keyword**, in the rendered spec, in both tables of contents, and in the VS Code sidebar's spec tree — so the surfaces agree on what a heading is called. This became removable only in 1.12.0: before the `ADDED Requirements` label was restored to visibility, the keyword was the only thing naming what these sections were. Presentation only — your files, every heading id and every deep link are untouched, and the VS Code tree keeps the authored text in its tooltip
- **The rule beside an open section now marks that section.** Consecutive requirements drew rules that met, forming a single unbroken line down the whole page: a bracket around everything says the same as no bracket at all. Each requirement now carries its own, ending where the requirement ends. A nested open scenario no longer draws a second rule of equal weight beside its parent's — the doubling read as one ornament repeated rather than as two levels
- **Expanding a scenario no longer nudges the rest of the page.** The gap between sections depended on what the last visible element inside one happened to be, so opening a scenario pushed every requirement below it down by a further 8px
- **A little more room around the fold** — the body sits further from the rule, and the disclosure arrow is no longer drawn against it
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.9.0 adds `specHeadingLabel`, the single rule behind the heading text every surface displays

## 1.12.0

**Highlight: spek now shows the workflow itself, not just its output.** A schema decides what a change *is* in OpenSpec — which artifacts exist, what order they come in, what each is supposed to contain, and when the change is ready to implement. spek has always rendered the products of that process and never the process. Until now the schema appeared only as a small badge on a change that differed from the repo default: a name with nothing behind it.

- **New Schemas page** listing every workflow schema available to the selected repo, with its description, its source (shipped with the `openspec` package, or project-local under `openspec/schemas/`), and how many artifacts it defines. The schema named by `openspec/config.yaml` is marked as the repo default, and each schema shows how many active changes declare it, with a link through to them. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen)
- **A schema detail view that reads as a workflow** — its artifacts in authoritative order as a diagram, each showing the file it generates, what it requires before it can be written, and its full instruction text. The `apply` step is drawn as the flow's terminal step, because "when is this change ready to implement" is part of what a reader is trying to understand
- **When the OpenSpec CLI cannot answer, the page says so.** If the CLI is missing, exits non-zero, times out, or emits something unparsable, the list comes back empty *with the reason stated*, rather than as an unexplained empty page. It does not substitute a reading of its own: which schemas exist, and which shadows which across the three directories OpenSpec searches, is a question only OpenSpec can answer
- **Schema reads stay off the scan hot path** — they happen only when schema information is asked for, and are cached per repo. Change lists, the overview and worktree aggregation are unaffected
- **Spec content is now ranked by structure rather than by inherited type size.** In a change's Specs tab the spec's own name was smaller than the `ADDED Requirements` label inside it — and, being an `h3` sibling of the content's `h2`s, it was *terminated* by the first one rather than containing them, leaving the requirements below attributed to no spec at all. The topic name is now the dominant heading of its section with a rule beneath it, the operation label is demoted, and an open section is inset with a hairline rule marking where it ends. Reported from the IntelliJ tool window (issue #42)
- **Every delta operation is marked, not an arbitrary two.** `REMOVED` and `RENAMED` had no styling of their own, so in prose they read as ordinary words. `REMOVED` deliberately does not take red: red already means "normative" (`MUST` / `SHALL`) in this renderer, and one colour carrying two meanings weakens both
- *Internal:* `@spekjs/core` 1.8.0 exposes the schema enumeration and reading API, and gains `yaml` as a runtime dependency

## 1.11.0

**Highlight: a spec opens as an outline with substance, instead of a wall of text.** Reported as "you are asked to read all these fine details, but you don't even really know the shape of the thing first" (issue #42, filed from the IntelliJ plugin).

- **Requirements and scenarios fold in place.** Each `### Requirement:` shows its heading *and* its lead SHALL paragraph; each `#### Scenario:` shows as a heading with its WHEN/THEN body collapsed. Scenario blocks are 59% of the character volume in this repo's own specs — so the first screen becomes a contents page that still says what each requirement requires, rather than a parallel index you have to leave the content to read. Expand all / Collapse all is available, and your choice is remembered
- **Find-in-page still finds folded text, and links still land.** Folding uses the browser's native disclosure elements rather than hiding content with CSS, so `Ctrl+F` reaches text inside a collapsed scenario. Navigating to a heading — from the table of contents, from a `#hash` on load, or from VS Code's navigate-to command — expands whatever encloses it before scrolling, so a link never arrives at something invisible
- **Folding applies only to spec-shaped content** — the spec detail page and a change's Specs tab. Proposal, design and other markdown artifacts render unfolded exactly as before
- **Every BDD keyword is legible in the light theme.** WHEN / THEN / SHALL and the rest were hard-coded to one set of colours shared by both themes, and against the light background all 8 failed WCAG AA — 7 below even 3:1, with `THEN` at **1.43:1**. The dark theme passed everywhere, which is why this went unseen. Light now has its own values in the same hue families, clearing AA at 5.17–6.47:1; dark is unchanged byte for byte, and no hue or pill fill moves on either theme
- **A highlighted keyword no longer renders lighter than the emphasis around it.** A keyword inside `**bold**` was drawn at a lower font weight than the bold text containing it
- *Internal:* the TypeScript and Kotlin task parsers are now verified against one shared fixture corpus, so a case added in one language is asserted by both from the next run. `@spekjs/core` also gained the artifact sort function that had been living in the web package

## 1.10.1

- **A `tasks.md` whose lines don't end in a plain newline is counted correctly, and counted the same on every surface.** A file using carriage-return line endings — a legacy Mac export, or a stray `\r` left in front of a Windows one — had checkboxes silently skipped: they appeared as ordinary text and contributed nothing to the progress count, so the total was simply wrong with nothing on screen to explain it. The IntelliJ plugin and the Web / VS Code surfaces also disagreed about the same file, because the two are separate implementations of one rule whose regex engines read the same pattern differently. Both now follow CommonMark, which counts a lone `\r` as a line ending like any other (issue #33)
- **An invisible-whitespace line no longer truncates the task above it.** A line holding only a no-break space — what a paste from a word processor or a web page often leaves behind — was treated as a blank line on Web and VS Code, and a blank line ends a task's continuation: every sub-bullet and paragraph after it vanished from the Tasks tab, with the line that caused it invisible. IntelliJ kept the same text, so the two surfaces showed different tasks. Both now use CommonMark's rule, where only spaces and tabs make a line blank
- **Nothing moves for a `tasks.md` that uses ordinary newlines** — the overwhelming majority. Both fixes were verified against a reference Markdown renderer, and every progress bar, count and CI badge in this repo is unchanged
- *Internal:* the unreferenced `server/lib/` copies of the core scanning logic were removed from the web package, and the repository gained CI quality gates plus automated npm publishing for `@spekjs/*`. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for the dead-code removal

## 1.10.0

**Highlight: the Tasks tab shows what your `tasks.md` actually says.** Two independent defects had made it the least faithful view in the app — one discarded content before it ever reached the UI, the other displayed what survived as literal source. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for reporting and contributing both.

- **A task's continuation lines are no longer discarded.** Sub-bullets, explanatory paragraphs and code blocks written underneath a `- [ ]` item were dropped by the parser itself, so they were missing from the data rather than merely hidden by styling — no amount of scrolling, resizing or switching surface would reveal them. In this repo's own openspec that was 90 of 1137 tasks, each showing only its first line. They now display as the source describes
- **Task text renders as Markdown.** The Tasks tab was the one artifact view whose text never reached a Markdown parser, so `**bold**` appeared as four asterisks and `` `code` `` as backticks around the word. Inline formatting, links, nested lists and code blocks now render as they do on every other tab. Links open in a new tab, matching the rest of the viewer
- **A bullet at column 0 after a checkbox stays outside that task.** A plain `- Note: …` line following a `- [ ]` item is a separate bullet in Markdown, and is now shown as one instead of being absorbed into the task above it as a nested list. The same applies to a heading, blockquote, code fence, numbered item or `---` — indent any of them and it still belongs to the task, exactly as Markdown reads it
- **Progress counts, section grouping and the CI task badge are unchanged.** Only checkboxes at column 0 are counted, as before; an indented `- [ ]` belongs to its parent task's text and is not a task of its own. This was verified across every `tasks.md` in this repo — no progress bar or badge value moves

## 1.9.2

- **Spec diffs stay readable on lines too wide to fit.** The red and green tints marking removed and added lines stopped at the first screenful, so scrolling right — exactly what you do to read a long line — left the changed text sitting on plain background, with nothing to say whether it was an addition or a removal. The tints now span the full scrollable width. Thanks to [@Katsz](https://github.com/Katsz) (Alex) for reporting and contributing this
- **The `··· N lines hidden ···` marker stays in view while you scroll a diff sideways.** Its label was centred against the diff's full width rather than the visible area, so on a wide diff it sat off-screen and the collapsed region looked like an unexplained gap. The label is now pinned to the left edge, the way a diff hunk header behaves

## 1.9.1

- **The IntelliJ plugin opens again on IDEs built on platform 2026.2.** Opening the Tool Window threw an IDE Internal Error and left no viewer at all, so the plugin was unusable — 2026.2 moved JCEF into a bundled plugin whose classes the plugin could no longer see (issue #24, reported on WebStorm 2026.2 with plugin 1.9.0). The embedded webview is restored, and JCEF being unavailable for any reason now degrades to the external-browser fallback instead of crashing — which is what makes the next platform change of this kind an inconvenience rather than an outage
- **The timeline's "group by topic" works when worktree aggregation is on.** Every change landed in the "(no topic)" lane, which read as though the repo had no spec relationships at all. Nothing looked broken — the chart rendered exactly as it does when the grouping is genuinely empty. Repos with a single worktree were unaffected (issue #25, reported by a downstream consumer of the `@spekjs/ui` package). Web and VS Code only; the IntelliJ plugin has no worktree aggregation, so it never hit this

## 1.9.0

**Highlight: Jujutsu (jj) workspace aggregation (experimental)** — spek can now see OpenSpec changes in jj workspaces, not just git worktrees. In a colocated git+jj repo, jj workspaces are invisible to `git worktree list`, so changes authored there used to be silently missed. This is **experimental and off by default** — enable it to opt in. Thanks to [@DannyGoodall](https://github.com/DannyGoodall) (Danny Goodall) for contributing this.

- When enabled, and a repo has jj initialised and the `jj` CLI is available, spek also discovers OpenSpec changes in every jj workspace and merges them into the same aggregated view as git worktrees
- The colocated main directory (both a git worktree and the jj `default` workspace) is deduplicated by path, so it is never double-counted
- Because jj workspaces share one commit graph (each materialises the full trunk), a shared change would otherwise appear once per workspace; jj changes are deduplicated by content, so a shared change is shown once. A workspace that has diverged on a change keeps its own entry, flagged "conflicts with &lt;base&gt;" (and "editing" if it's the `@` change)
- This runs **alongside, and separately from**, the git-worktree deduplication added in 1.8.1. jj workspaces are invisible to git and their working-copy commit isn't a git ref, so they can't use git's history-based election; they get their own content-fingerprint path instead. Git-worktree behaviour is unchanged
- Opt in via the VS Code setting `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` (**experimental, off by default**) or the Web aggregation control's "Worktrees + jj" option — independent of git worktree aggregation
- Degrades gracefully: when disabled, or `jj` is not installed, or the repo is not a jj repo, behaviour is identical to before — `jj` is never required
- Supported in the Web version and the VS Code extension (IntelliJ and Demo are unchanged)

**The aggregation scope is now one control in the app header (Web and VS Code).** It used to be a checkbox on the Changes page, which meant it only existed on that page even though it changes what the Dashboard, Graph and Timeline show as well. It is now a single control in the header — `Current dir` / `Worktrees` / `Worktrees + jj` — visible from every page, and it appears only when there is more than one working copy to aggregate.

- The three states are mutually exclusive, so the meaningless combination "don't aggregate, but do include jj" can no longer be selected. The `Worktrees + jj` option is offered only when a jj workspace is actually detected
- In VS Code the control writes the settings, not a hidden preference: it edits `spek.aggregateWorktrees` and `spek.aggregateJjWorkspaces` in your workspace `settings.json` (and editing those settings by hand updates the control). `spek.aggregateWorktrees` is new — worktree aggregation was previously not configurable there. On the Web the choice is remembered in the browser
- The IntelliJ plugin does not aggregate, so no control is shown there

## 1.8.3

- **Lists with blank lines between their items render correctly again (Web, VS Code and IntelliJ).** Every bullet and number was pushed onto its own line, above the text it belonged to, which made proposals and task lists hard to scan. Markers now sit inline with the first line of their item. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for reporting and contributing this.

## 1.8.2

- **Opening a change is much faster (Web, VS Code and IntelliJ).** Each change took about a second to open. To order a change's tabs, spek asks the OpenSpec CLI for the artifact order that the change's schema defines — and it repeated that request for every change, even though every change sharing a schema gets the same answer back. The answer is now looked up once per schema instead of once per change, so only the first change you open pays for it and the rest open immediately.

## 1.8.1

- **Changes shared across git worktrees no longer show up multiple times (Web and VS Code).** When you work in several worktrees of one repo, each inherits a copy of every open change; spek was listing every copy, cluttering the Changes list and the dependency Graph, and inflating each spec's fan-in count in the graph. It now shows one entry per change — the copy from the worktree actually editing it — decided from git history (which worktree has advanced the change past the main worktree) rather than file timestamps as the primary signal; timestamps now only break a tie between copies that have *both* genuinely advanced. Because a fresh worktree rewrites every file's timestamp on checkout, the old timestamp-first guess could pick an idle, never-touched copy and make an in-progress change look reset to zero; that no longer happens. Thanks to [@david-lutz](https://github.com/david-lutz) (David Lutz) for contributing this.

  **Note:** the IntelliJ plugin has its own copy of the scanning logic and is not fixed by this release — changes still appear once per worktree there.

## 1.8.0

- **The Refresh button now actually refreshes.** The circular-arrow button at the bottom of the sidebar — previously labelled "Resync" — only rebuilt an internal cache. It never re-fetched what was on screen, so if you edited a file and pressed it, nothing happened; you had to navigate away and back before your change showed up. It now re-fetches, and it keeps spinning until the new data has actually arrived instead of stopping before it lands (which made a working refresh look like a broken one). Thanks to [@deniskrizanovic](https://github.com/deniskrizanovic) for reporting.
- **A dead live-update connection is no longer silent (Web).** spek normally refreshes on its own when files change, over a background connection that can drop without any outward sign. When it drops, the sidebar now says so and points you at Refresh, rather than leaving you staring at stale content with no indication that anything is wrong. **Note:** this makes the failure *visible*; it does not yet make the connection recover on its own. If auto-refresh stops, press Refresh.
- **IntelliJ: the Refresh button was completely dead.** The plugin's built-in server had no endpoint for it, so every click returned HTTP 404 and the frontend gave up silently. The endpoint now exists, and Refresh no longer depends on it succeeding.
- **IntelliJ: stopped a pointless background retry loop.** The webview mistook itself for the web app and kept reconnecting, forever, to a path the plugin's server never serves.

## 1.7.0

- **spek has moved to the `spekhq` GitHub organization** — the repository is now [`spekhq/spek`](https://github.com/spekhq/spek). Clones, links, issues, and stars redirect automatically, so for most users there is nothing to do. **Two things do not redirect:**
  - **GitHub Action users must update their workflows** — change `uses: kewang/spek@v1` to `uses: spekhq/spek@v1`. GitHub deliberately does not redirect action references (a redirect would let a rename hijack someone else's action), so the old path now fails with `repository not found`.
  - **The live demo and the README badges moved** to `https://spekhq.github.io/spek/`. GitHub Pages is not redirected after a transfer, so the old `kewang.github.io/spek/` URLs are gone for good.
- **GitHub Action: fixed a build failure that hit every run** — the action never built `@spekjs/ui` explicitly; it got that package's `dist` for free from an install-time hook that `npm ci` happened to run. When the hook moved to publish time (so `npm ci` would stop failing in the publish pipelines), the action silently lost its `@spekjs/ui` build and every run died resolving `@spekjs/ui/styles.css`. Pinning an older tag did not help — the action builds spek from `master` by default, so the breakage reached everyone at once. The action now builds `@spekjs/ui` explicitly.

## 1.6.1

- **TOC navigation lands on the section you clicked** — clicking a table-of-contents entry, or opening a `#hash` deep link, on a Change or Spec detail page no longer scrolls the target heading behind the sticky header, which made it look like the click had jumped one section too far. The offset is now measured from the header that is actually rendered instead of an assumed 80px, and the entry you clicked is the one the TOC highlights.
- **Schema badge under worktree aggregation** — when changes are aggregated across worktrees, each change's schema is now compared against the default schema of the worktree it actually lives in, rather than the main worktree's. A change that uses its own worktree's default no longer shows a badge, and the list and detail views agree on this. Scanning also reads each worktree's `openspec/config.yaml` once instead of once per change.

Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for both.

## 1.6.0

- **Hideable tree navigator (IntelliJ)** — the Specs / Changes tree in the spek tool window can now be hidden from the tool window title bar or its gear (⋮) menu, giving the viewer the full tool window. The choice is remembered per project, and the split ratio is persisted too instead of resetting every time you reopen the project. While hidden, the tree no longer rebuilds on file changes; it refreshes when you bring it back. Thanks to [@deniskrizanovic](https://github.com/deniskrizanovic) for reporting.

## 1.5.0

- **Custom OpenSpec schemas** — a change's artifacts are now discovered from disk, so a change authored under any schema (not just the built-in `spec-driven`) renders every artifact as its own tab. Previously anything outside `proposal` / `design` / `tasks` / `specs` was silently dropped. Full-text search now indexes every markdown artifact as well.
- **Artifact tab ordering** — tabs default to last-modified order so the artifact you're actively editing surfaces first. A sort control adds **Schema order** (sourced from the OpenSpec CLI, degrading gracefully to the default order when the CLI is unavailable or the change is archived) and **A–Z**. The choice persists across changes.
- **Schema badge** — each change's schema is shown as a badge on the Changes list, the Dashboard, and Change Detail. It is hidden when the change uses the repo's default schema (from `openspec/config.yaml`), so a badge always means "this change uses a non-default schema"; the Changes page states the repo default as a plain-text label.

Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for contributing all of the above.

## 1.4.0

- Live-reload now works inside devcontainers and WSL. On filesystems that don't deliver native OS change events (9p / drvfs / NFS / CIFS / FUSE), spek automatically falls back to polling — so files created or edited after opening it are still detected. Detection is based on the watched path's filesystem type and needs no configuration; an optional `SPEK_WATCH_POLLING=on|off` escape hatch exists only if you ever need to force it. Applies to the Web, VS Code, and IntelliJ live variants. Thanks to [@nthansen](https://github.com/nthansen) (Norman Hansen) for contributing this feature.

## 1.3.4

- Fix: the Timeline no longer falls back to "No timeline data" when a change's `created:` date is set correctly. The IntelliJ plugin's backend never read `created:` from `.openspec.yaml` (so every change lost its created date on the Timeline), and the Web / VS Code parser dropped `created:` from files saved with CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings. Both backends now surface `createdDate` and `archivedDate` consistently, and the Timeline empty state no longer wrongly claims the `created:` field is missing.

## 1.3.3

- Fix: the IntelliJ plugin now installs on IntelliJ Platform 2026.1 (build 261.x) and newer — the `until-build` upper bound (`253.*`) that caused "requires IDE build 253.* or earlier" has been removed, so the plugin tracks current and future IDE releases (#4)
- Update the published `kewang/spek` GitHub Action off the deprecated Node 20 runtime — bump `actions/checkout` to v7, `actions/setup-node` to v6, and `actions/cache` to v6; internal CI workflows and README examples updated to match (#7)

## 1.3.2

- Update VS Code Marketplace keywords/tags for better discoverability — replace `bdd` with `sdd`, add `spec-driven-development` and `ai`, and drop `documentation` / `viewer`

## 1.3.1

- Fix: a fresh clone now starts cleanly with `npm install && npm run dev` — `@spek/core` resolves to its gitignored `dist/` build, which neither install nor dev used to produce, so the Express API failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and Vite failed to resolve `@spek/core/headings`. `npm install` now compiles `@spek/core` (new `prepare` script) and the root `dev` script rebuilds it before launching (#2)

## 1.3.0

**Highlight: Cross-worktree aggregation** — when you run agents in parallel across multiple git worktrees, spek now shows the OpenSpec content of *all* worktrees in one place, instead of forcing you to point spek at each worktree by hand.

- Point spek at any directory and it auto-discovers every git worktree of the same repo, then merges their active changes, archived changes, and the spec-change graph into a single unified view
- Each change card / row is tagged with its source worktree branch, so you can tell at a glance which worktree a change lives in
- A toggle turns aggregation off to view only the current directory
- Active changes from each worktree coexist (same-named slugs are both shown, identified by their source worktree); archived changes are deduped by slug; the specs list always comes from the main worktree
- Aggregation is the default whenever multiple worktrees are detected — single-worktree or non-git repos behave exactly as before
- Supported in the Web version and the VS Code extension (IntelliJ and Demo are unchanged)
- Fix: the VS Code extension now uses chokidar for file watching, so newly created nested directories (e.g. a change's `specs/<topic>/spec.md`) are detected and the change-detail spec tab live-reloads correctly

## 1.2.0

- Add `/timeline` page: horizontal Gantt-style chart of every change's lifecycle — active bars extend to today with an arrow, archived bars render as fixed segments
- Timeline supports an optional "Group by topic" toggle and "Hide active / Hide archived" filter chips, plus an auto-scaling time axis (daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly ticks based on span)
- Read `created:` from `.openspec.yaml` and derive `archivedDate` from archive folder name; surface lifecycle info in `ChangeInfo` / `ChangeDetail` (server payload adds two backwards-compatible fields)
- ChangeList row shows `Created Apr 20 · 5d ago` for active changes and `Created Feb 14 → Archived Feb 22 · 8d` for archived ones
- ChangeDetail header gains a lifecycle banner (e.g., `Created 2026-02-14 · Archived 2026-02-22 (8 days)` or `Active for 5 days`)
- Dashboard adds two stats cards: **Avg lifecycle (archived)** and **Stale active (>30d)**
- VS Code sidebar shows lifecycle days in change descriptions and includes the created date in tooltips
- New `@spek/web` test runner (`npm test -w @spek/web`) covers the timeline scale and grouping helpers

## 1.1.0

- Add table-of-contents (TOC) sidebar to spec detail pages — sticky navigation lists all `h2`/`h3` headings, with scrollspy highlighting and smooth scrolling on click
- Add TOC sidebar to change detail pages for the Proposal, Design, and Specs tabs (Tasks tab excluded); TOC updates when switching tabs
- Persist the active tab in the change detail URL (`?tab=<id>`) and support deep links with both tab + hash (e.g., `?tab=design#decision-1`)
- Specs tab: prefix each delta spec's heading ids with `<topic>--` so multiple specs with the same heading text no longer collide
- Support URL hash anchors on spec detail pages (e.g., `/specs/foo#requirement-bar` scrolls to that heading)
- Expand spec items in the VS Code sidebar to reveal their headings as child nodes; clicking a heading opens the webview at the corresponding section
- Add `extractHeadings` and `slugifyHeading` utilities to `@spek/core` for shared heading parsing across web and extension hosts
- Web: reloads and direct URL visits now restore the most recent repo from localStorage instead of bouncing back to the repo-selection page
